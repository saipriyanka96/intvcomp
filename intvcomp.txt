Difference between Interpreter and Compiler

Interpreter
1)Interpreter converts high level language into some other intermediate form
2)It will scan each and every line and translates the program 
3)Less time to analyze the source code
4) The execution time is slower
5) There is no intermediate object code generation,so memory efficiency will be there
6) It scans line by line. It will be easy to solve the errans.So debugging is easy
7)Examples:Python,Ruby use  as interpreters


Compiler
1)Compiler converts the high level instructions into machine language
2)It will scan whole program at once and translate that code into machine code
3)More time to analyze the source code
4)The execution time time faster
5)It links the code because of faster generation of intermediate object code,hence 
requires more memory
6)It scans whole program at once,after scanning only it will show the errors.
So debugging will be harder.
7)Examples: C,C++ uses as complier
